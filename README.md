This is my first project. It is a project to compute the reciprocal gamma function.

This project is still in the very early stages of development.

I have conducted numerous coding experiments to try to ascertain the best strategy
to follow.

Many of these experiments have not given me the results I am hoping for-
and I am continuing to explore the ways to give me improved accuracy.

It is a project that uses Rust programming language.

The strategy is to use an adaptation of the Spouge approximation to directly compute
the reciprocal gamma function and then to enhance the accuracy of the result
using polynomial interpolation.

The interpolation used will probably be based on orthogonal polynomials such as 
Chebyshev or Laguerre polynomials.

I hope I am on the right path with this, and I look forward to feedback.

I welcome collaboration with this project, but as far as timelines are concerned I do
not know how long it will take to achieve.
